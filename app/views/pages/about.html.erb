        When starting the project, I decided the two most important aspects of the development process were having a solid design to follow, and practising continuous deployment (to Heroku) to make sure the app was fully functional before submitting. Normally before writing any code I enjoy drawing out basic designs by hand, all-be-it rather crudely. Once happy with a basic layout I feel more comfortable continuing with the actual build. As per the challenge’s request, on one HTML page I would have the weather information fetched and inserted into the page with javascript into a mobile swiper. Funnily enough i had actually previously built a weather app using React and Redux, so I did know of the Openweathermap api, (and just how cool it was). However I wanted to create something different for the challenge, and just using basic javascript, no libaries.

        I decided to build the app within Rails as it’s a framework I’m comfortable using, and the template I used has a lot of useful preset configurations and addons like webpacker for compiling JS etc. I decided that the most important thing to do first was to fetch and display basic data from the openweathermap forecast api. Th main problem I came across when first using the api was understanding how to create a more global weather app, not region based. The problem is openweathermap recommends that you use city ids to reference a city - however the list of IDs seems to only be available as a local file, (which is over 20mb), prompting me to make my app UK only. This was as simple as stating ${search.value},<b>UK</b> in the fetch request. In picture 3 is the first basic information recieved, and in picture 4 the data has been put into a swiper.
