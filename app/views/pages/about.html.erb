        When starting the project, I decided the two most important aspects of the development process were having a solid design to follow, and practising continuous deployment (to Heroku) to make sure the app was fully functional before submitting. Normally before writing any code I enjoy drawing out basic designs by hand, all-be-it rather crudely. Once happy with a basic layout I feel more comfortable continuing with the actual build. As per the challenge’s request, on one HTML page I would have the weather information fetched and inserted into the page with javascript into a mobile swiper. Funnily enough i had actually previously built a weather app using React and Redux, so I did know of the Openweathermap api, (and just how cool it was). However I wanted to create something different for the challenge, and just using basic javascript, no libaries.

        I decided to build the app within Rails as it’s a framework I’m comfortable using, and the template I used has a lot of useful preset configurations and addons like webpacker for compiling JS etc. I decided that the most important thing to do first was to fetch and display basic data from the openweathermap forecast api. Th main problem I came across when first using the api was understanding how to create a more global weather app, not region based. The problem is openweathermap recommends that you use city ids to reference a city - however the list of IDs seems to only be available as a local file, (which is over 20mb), prompting me to make my app UK only. This was as simple as stating ${search.value},<b>UK</b> in the fetch request. In picture 3 is the first basic information recieved, and in picture 4 the data has been put into a swiper, along with matching google maps icon, which I later decided to put in a container below the swiper, like in my second design.

        The code in the picture below contains three examples of solutions to tasks I wanted to complete. First of all, I decided it would be neater to just have one result per search instead of a list of searches (like the react app) so I included a build page function which cleared the inner html of the page before displaying the results again. Second, I realised that I hadn't included any sort of form validation for either blank or incorrect searches. The first formValidation() function is fairly self-explaniatory, if the value of search is nil (after the click) then throw up an alert. Thinking of how to check for incorrect cities, I realised that the api throws back a 404, so I placed an if statement after the fetch which would check for a valid city name. Third, I decided that I wanted to also display the current weather for the city location, and not just a 5 day forecast. Therefore in order to use both apis form openweathermap, I put them into an array and referenced each one seperately in two different fetches. Like before the data from both fetches was inserted into two swiper cards.

      <h3>Areas for improvement:</h3>
      <p>
        In terms of responsive design I would have separate containers for both the apis, instead of having a mobile like swiper. It would be an improvement in terms of both design and functionality - it is not immediately evident in the desktop view that you can see additional weather information straight away. The main thing I am looking into currently is search on smaller iOS devices, as once anything has been typed into the search bar, the search button stops working, rendering the app useless. This is confusing as the problem does not seem to be happening on android devices, some with even smaller resolution screens. Currently fixing as we speak.
